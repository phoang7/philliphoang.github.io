        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer in Washington. I previously worked at VMware (from July 2022 to August 2024) as 
            a backend software engineer where I worked on mantaining and developing new features for 
            backend services on VMware Cloud on AWS. During my time, I developed and maintained workflows to ensure 
            hosts were able to be replaced or remediated such that hosts were healthy and highly available for 
            clusters, SDDCs, and orgs. My strongest skills and work experience are primarily in Java, Python, 
            REST APIs, and the Spring Framework. I enjoy solving challenging problems and designing software,
            and am always looking to learn/grow! I also graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Mathematics in June 2022.
